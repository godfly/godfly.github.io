Prior to joining Meituan, I obtained my Master's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My research interests have evolved from natural language processing and machine translation to currently emphasizing the development and application of large language models. I am dedicated to investigating the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in addressing complex challenges.
